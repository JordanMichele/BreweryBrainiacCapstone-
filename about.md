I'm a craft beer enthusiast and love the art of creating craft beer. I live in Rochester NY where there are tons of craft breweries and its an awesome problem to have. With so many options its overwhelming for an avid craft beer drinker like myself to keep up with all the new beer alerts, events and new breweries popping up. After a long night of searching from website to website, Facebook to Twitter to Instagram all to end up with frustration and maybe a couple too many beers, I decided to take it upon myself to create The Brewery Brainiac. The Brewery Brainiac is a simple craft beer blog based in Rochester NY which informs users all they need to know in the craft beer scene(new beer alerts, events, pictures, promotions and of course info about new breweries opening up. This app utilized HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Bootstrap, Google Maps API, Open Weather Map API and jQuery.
